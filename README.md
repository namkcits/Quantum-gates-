# Quantum  with Hadamard Gate

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple quantum circuit with a single qubit and apply a Hadamard gate to it using Qiskit.

## Requirements

- Qiskit: A framework for quantum computing in Python. Install it using `pip install qiskit`.

- Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python. Install it using `pip install matplotlib`.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages mentioned in the **Requirements** section.

2. Run the code using a Python interpreter or execute it in a Python script.

The code performs the following steps:

1. Creates a quantum circuit with a single qubit.

2. Applies a Hadamard gate to the qubit.

3. Saves the circuit in QASM format to a file named `circuit.qasm`.

4. Visualizes the circuit using matplotlib.

5. Simulates the circuit using the statevector simulator in Qiskit.

6. Retrieves the final statevector of the qubit.

7. Plots the histogram of the probabilities of measuring the qubit in the computational basis.
